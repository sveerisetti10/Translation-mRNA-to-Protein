# Translation-mRNA-to-Protein

This is code that wrote for my BF 527 Bioinformatics course at Boston University. The code produces a protein sequence from an mRNA file. The produced protein sequence can be entered into the BLAST database in order to garner the protein identity of an amino acid sequence.
